## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I am Aakif Kohari,
Currently Studying BE Computer Science & Technology (Data Science)
at Anjuman-I-Islam Kalsekar Technical Campus.

I am Interested in Coding as I am fascinated by how computers work.

I have learned C language and am currently learning C++, Javascript and Python. Besides my usual Studies.

Though I don't know that much, I am willing to help with the knowledge I have.

I am new to this so I may make mistakes as I don't know much about git, github and licensing.
If I make any Mistakes, I am sorry in advance and please guide me to not make such mistakes again.

**_THANK YOU_**
